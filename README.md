# Git / GitHub

Your Git knowledge has been taken further by consistently using add/commit for every new feature implemented. You have also worked on branches other than main or master, ensuring a proper branching strategy.

# Contact Us

The Contact Us form and API have been aligned by updating the API to accept all form fields. Messages are now being stored in MongoDB, and successful saving of all form field data is being verified. A new Contact Us Schema has been created to accommodate the changes.

# Validator

A validator middleware has been created to validate input fields such as email and phone number in the Contact Us form. The Validator NPM package has been utilized to implement this functionality.

# Request Quote

The calc-residential API has been updated to meet the requirements. It has been renamed to GET /calc and now accepts the building type as a path parameter (industrial, commercial, residential). Path parameters are validated to ensure their correctness.

# Residential Page - Agent Table

On the Residential Services landing page, a table has been added to display agent information fetched from MongoDB. Color coding has been implemented based on ratings, enabling sorting of the table by name, rating, and fee. Filtering by region has also been implemented.

# Residential Page - Agent Table Validator

Middleware validators have been utilized to ensure the correct region is passed in the Residential Page - Agent Table. This validator middleware ensures that only valid regions are accepted.

You have made great progress and accomplished these tasks successfully. Keep up the good work!
